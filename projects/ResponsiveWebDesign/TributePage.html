                 No words can express the loss I feel, but in spite of this, am thankful to God for giving us a true gem of our times. A man who inspired selfless love and sacrifice for his people in a humble and quiet way. Thank you for being a shining light of hope all my life. Rest in eternal peace.

                    Even though he physical demise was expected, as all of us will sure pass on, Madiba’s passing away was a shock. As we grew up in apartheid, living in fear, suffering, humiliation, someway in dark dungeon he and his colleagues in jail were our hope. This hope never disappeared and never disappointed when he emerged in 1990.

                   May he rest in peace. May those who followed in his leadership shoes learn the art of selfless serving and sacrifice. May we all renew our resolve to let no one suffer when we can do something about it. May those who bully and inflict pain, suffering and discrimination NEVER NEVER and NEVER get away with it.
                   
                   I am personally greatful that some of my achievement in life have been facilited by Nelson Mandela’s struggle and personal sacrifice.
                   
                   May his spirit of serving live within us forever.
                   
                   Amen

                      Dear Madiba,
                     You have taken a bow on this world’s stage and been promoted to glory to revel in the presence of our Lord and maker. I can picture it all, you seated on a stool surrounded by those who have gone before us as you regale them with tales of your illustrious life fraught with trials and tribulations from which you emerged victorious and with renewed determination. In the words of one of my favourite hymns, “It is well with your soul” now, free from pain and any form of affliction. May your selflessness and courage continue to be a beacon of hope for the downtrodden in our struggle to be freed from all forms of discrimination and social exclusion. Even though you have ceased to be with us physically, your spirit lives on in our hearts. In the eternal words of that enduring song by Boyz To Men and Mariah Carey, “And I know you’re shining down on me from heaven, like so many friends we’ve lost along the way, and I know eventually we’ll be together, one sweet day”. May your soul rest in eternal peace Madiba, amen.

                       Mandela yu were an icon, a man who fought for what was right. Human rights and freedom! You have left us but you have left your people and the people of the world with peace and knowing that it was not in vain for all that you suffered for. Today, the people of South Africa are enjoying their freedom and that is what we all need to do in our life here on earth. LEAVE A MARK that is positive in peoples lives.
                       
                       May the good Lord keep His family in peace at this time of mourning our Hero our icon….

                                Merci M. Mandela,
                                depuis 1988, votre image et votre nom m’étaient familiers. Depuis 1988, vos valeurs m’ont aidé à surmonter certaines épreuves. Mon fils a appris votre nom très jeune…
                                Et depuis trois jours, je pleure plus que pour le décès de membres de ma famille…
                                Reposez en paix auprès des vôtres.
