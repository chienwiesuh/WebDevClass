                A patent is a form of intellectual property that gives its owner the <code> right to exclude others from making, using, selling and importing an invention</code> for a limited period of years, in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most countries patent rights fall under civil law and the patent holder needs to sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce his or her rights. In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage; in others they are irrelevant.

                    <p>
                        A specification often refers to a <code> set of documented requirements</code> to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.[1] A specification is often a type of technical standard.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.[2] It is a common early part of engineering design and product development processes, in many fields.

                    <p>
                        A test method is a method for a test in science or engineering,<code>  such as a physical test</code>, chemical test, or statistical test. It is a definitive procedure that produces a test result.[1] In order to ensure accurate and relevant test results, a test method should be "explicit, unambiguous, and experimentally feasible.",[2] as well as effective[3] and reproducible.[4]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A test can be considered an observation or experiment that determines one or more characteristics of a given sample, product, process, or service. The purpose of testing involves a prior determination of expected observation and a comparison of that expectation to what one actually observes.[5] The results of testing can be qualitative (yes/no), quantitative (a measured value), or categorical and can be derived from personal observation or the output of a precision measuring instrument.

                    <p>
                        A datasheet, data-sheet, or spec sheet is<code>  a document that summarizes the performance and other characteristics of a product, machine, component</code> (e.g., an electronic component), material, subsystem (e.g., a power supply), or software in sufficient detail that allows a buyer to understand what the product is and a design engineer to understand the role of the component in the overall system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A datasheet is usually used for commercial or technical communication to describe the characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical specification is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.

                    <p>
                        Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made.<code> These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes</code> to become the required part.
